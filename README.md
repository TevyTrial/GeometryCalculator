# Geometry Calculator

## Description
This project consists of a `Geometry` class with static methods to calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle. 
It also includes a `GeometryCalculator` class that provides a user-friendly menu interface to perform these calculations interactively. 
The program ensures proper error handling for invalid input values (e.g., negative dimensions).

## Features
- Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.
- Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
- Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.
- Error handling for negative input values and number input outside 1 to 4.

## Practice
- Usage of Java classes and objects, method overriding
- Practice class collaboration
Geometry Class:
The `Geometry` class includes the calculation static methods:

GeometryCalculator Class:
The `GeometryCalculator.java` provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with and perform various calculations.
